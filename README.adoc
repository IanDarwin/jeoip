= jeoip

This code gives access to the GeoIP free database of IP-to-country geolocation data.

The jeoip project was written before GeoIP produced their own Java library.
It is also completely free, under the BSD 2-clause license.

== Running

Before you can run the tests or the library, you must have the GeoIP Country database installed.
On OpenBSD you can satisfy this requirement by installing the GeoIP "db" flavor.
On other systems you'll have to install it in `/usr/local/share/examples/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat`.

== Notice

This product consumes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com .
