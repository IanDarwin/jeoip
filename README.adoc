*Discontinued* - MaxMind changed the data format and they provide
their own free Java API.
Please use https://github.com/maxmine/GeoIP2-java.

== Legacy Information

This code gives access to the GeoIP free database of IP-to-country geolocation data.

It is free software, under the BSD 2-clause license.

== Running

Before you can run the tests or the library, you must have the GeoIP Country database installed.
On OpenBSD you can satisfy this requirement by installing the GeoIP data package, i.e., 

	doas pkg_add geolite-country

On other systems you'll have to install `GeoIP.dat` in `/usr/local/share/examples/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat`,
or in some other directory that is pointed to by the environment variable `GEOIP_DIR`.

== Notice

This product uses GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com .
